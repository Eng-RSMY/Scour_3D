Log on to stutil:

ssh -Y -C [user name]@us.navo.hpc.mil

Note: you need the "-Y" and "-C" for X11 window forwarding so that you can actually use the MATLAB desktop interface.

once on stutil, get an interactive job.  From the command line:

qsub -A USNAM37752431 -q parallel -I -V -l select=1:ncpus=16:mpiprocs=16:ngpus=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 

Once the job has started, verify that there are MATLAB licenses available:

from the command line:
SLB_all_avail.pl matlab

If at least 2 are available, add the matlab R2016a module:

from the command line:
module load matlab/R2016a

launch matlab from the command line:
matlab &

have fun!
